### Car Insurance Quote
This project serves as an online quote tool for a car insurance company. The user can enter in their information and get an instant quote that tells them their monthly price.

### Blackjack Console Game
This is a console app for the user to play a game of blackjack against a casino dealer. The user can input their name and how much money they entered the casino with. They can them place bets on each hand. The game ends when the user selects to not continue the game, or if the player runs out of money.

### Income Comparison Console App
A quick tool that takes in two people and their income, and determines who makes more money.

### Shipping Quote Console App
A tool that asks for the user's size and weight of their shipment and calculates how much it would cost to ship.
